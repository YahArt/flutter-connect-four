# About this project
A simple connect four game written in flutter

# Setup Windows Build
This application also runs as a Windows Build. In order for this to work the following commands should be executed:
- `flutter channel dev`
- `flutter upgrade`
- `flutter config --enable-windows-desktop`

When these steps are done run the command `flutter doctor` to see if anything is wrong. You probably also need to install Visual Studio in order for the Windows Build to work.
